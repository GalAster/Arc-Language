ARC lastest
===========
*Arc Readable Configuration*

Purpose
-------

- ARC is a readable serialization format that can be used as a configuration file and log file
- ARC can be unambiguously mapped to a hash table, and other languages can easily parse out the encapsulated data structure.
- ARC is designed to be compressed into a single line, which means that line breaks and spaces are indifferent.
